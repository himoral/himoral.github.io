excerpt: 'This study is pioneering as it empirically scrutinizes how social cognition traits of IVAs impact the expectation-confirmation process. Unravelling this dimension of human-computer interaction, particularly its evolving influence on prolonged usage - especially for experience-like IVAs that simulate human-to-human interaction as opposed to traditional human-computer interaction - is pivotal.'

Unravelling this dimension of human-computer interaction, particularly its evolving influence on prolonged usage - especially for experience-like IVAs that simulate human-to-human interaction as opposed to traditional human-computer interaction - is pivotal.
