Here is Sihan Cheng(Lorenzo,ÊàêÊÄùÁø∞)
I am a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Business Administration at Zhejiang University of Technology. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Cao](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/congcao/) in Information Systems research and [Dr.May](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/mjy/) in Strategy ÔºÜ Inovation management research.<i>(Due to the Asian Games, these sites might can not be accessed, but they all great teachers!)</i> Under their guidance, I have a great academic time. Here is my Research Interest.

Research Interest
======
Unlike other students, my current research covers a wide range of topics from digital platform and innovation to human-AI interaction and consumer behaviour. And I categories them into three main topics: 

**Digital Platform and Innovation**

I was insipred and conducted research proposed by Gawer, who consider platform as a meta organization. Instead of system perspective proposed in IS field and organization perspective proposed in Organization Behaviour filed, we consider digital platform as an ecosystem that made up from one critical company and many complementors including other companies and all users. 

**Gamification and Sustainability** 

Alibaba, the top tier internet company in China, continuous emphasize their ESG strategy in recent years. Interestingly, besides green energy and so on traditional aspects, Alipay, the bigest mobile payment platform in China, turned its eye on consumer daily low-carbon lifestyle. To encourage green behaviour, Ant Forest and so on mini gamified APP occured in the Taobao, Alipay and so on APPs, which made significant progress in past years and research on such phenomenon published by "Science". Therefore, i think there must be lots of opportunities. 

**Human-AI Interaction (Human-AI team)**

As advancements in AI technologies continue, a plethora of companies have begun implementing AI tools into their daily workflows, essentially employing them as new team members. However, effectively utilizing these AI assistants requires employees to share their knowledge and information, a procedure many companies find challenging to incentivize. Despite this, studies suggest that humans are inclined to share more private information with AI than with other humans and an organizational environment that supports knowledge-sharing behaviours. Yet, it remains unclear how human-AI interactions within team settings influence colleagues' knowledge sharing behaviours and whether social cognitions of AI contribute to improved company performance.
