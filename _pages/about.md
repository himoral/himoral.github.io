Here is Sihan Cheng(Lorenzo,ÊàêÊÄùÁø∞)
I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Business Management at Zhejiang University of Technology.I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Pro.Cao](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/congcao/) in Information Systems research and [Dr.May](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/mjy/) in Strategy ÔºÜ Inovation management research. Under their guidance, I have been working on explainable recommendation. Here is my Research Interest.

Research Interest
======
Unlike other students, my current research covers a wide range of topics from digital platform and innovation to human-AI interaction and consumer behaviour. And i dived them into three main topics: 

1.Digital Platform and Innovation

I was insipred and conducted research proposed by Gawer, who consider platform as a meta organization. Instead of system perspective proposed in IS field and organization perspective proposed in Organization Behaviour filed, we consider digital platform as an ecosystem that made up from one critical company and many complementors including other companies and all users. 

2.Gamification and Sustainabe 

Alibaba, the top tier internet company in China, continuous emphasize their ESG strategy in recent years. Interestingly, besides green energy and so on traditional aspects, Alipay, the bigest mobile payment platform in China, turned its eye on consumer daily low-carbon lifestyle. To encourage green behaviour, Ant Forest and so on mini gamified APP occured in the Taobao, Alipay and so on APPs, which made significant progress in past years and research on such phenomenon published by "Science". Therefore, i think there must be lots of opportunities. 

3.Human-AI Interaction 

As ChatGPT advances, we have to re-evaluate our relationship with AI. In previous studies, they proposed Social AI and Social Robot. However, there is still a gap of how we treat and cognize New type of AI and Robots.
